# Notation Project

The Notation Project was to create generic data structures that followed the
given interfaces, such as MyQueue and MyStack. These classes had essential features like size tracking,
dequeuing/popping, and enqueueing/pushing, and they used an ArrayList for effective element storage.
Robust techniques for determining fullness, emptiness, and string conversion were emphasized. Three
essential activities were the focus of the Notation utility class: evaluatePostfix, which evaluates postfix
expressions, infix to postfix conversion (infixToPostfix), and postfix to infix conversion (postfixToInfix).
Using the generic queue (MyQueue) to convert infix to postfix allowed for a more efficient workflow,
according to the designated algorithms for every task. Exception classes, which cover situations like
incorrect notations and stack/queue overflow/underflow, were developed to handle mistakes properly.
